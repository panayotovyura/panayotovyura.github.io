## Recycle batteries.

Idea of "Recycle batteries" web application is to count amount of collected batteries.

There is a box for used batteries and a computer near the box, with our web application. When someone
brings old batteries – he throws them into the box and submit a form in application. The form is about
"I&nbsp;added 2 batteries of type AAA to the box".

After a couple of days, when the box is almost full, we could get a statistics, what is inside the box?
For example, there would be 12 AAA batteries, 20 AA batteries and 5 "undefined" ones. No idea,
whether this statistics was important or not, but it is a good example to build a simple web application on Symfony.
So, let’s start:

## 1. Install a Symfony framework.
 
Check, that your computer is able to run Symfony. If you are new to Symfony 3, find out how that demo bundle works.

To download Symfony and create project you may start with:

{% highlight bash %}
$ sudo curl -LsS https://symfony.com/installer -o /usr/local/bin/symfony
$ sudo chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/symfony
$ symfony new batteries
{% endhighlight %}

## 2. Implement functionality.

Create a page with form to add information about batteries. 
Form must contain fields: "Type", "Count" and "Name". "Name" is not required field, even anonymous one can give us
used batteries☺. After form is submitted, the record about added batteries is stored in database.

![Form][warmup_form]

Create a page with statistics of collected batteries. There must be a table on this page with two columns:
"Battery type" and "Total count"

![Statistics][warmup_statistics]

## 3. Write functional test for "statistics" feature. 

Required test cases:
 
* Check form functionality (fill and submit)
* Check statistics page (Battery type grouping and correct total count)

## 4. Share your code.

Register account on [GitHub][github]. Create open source project, commit your code and send the link as a result of
fulfilled home task.
